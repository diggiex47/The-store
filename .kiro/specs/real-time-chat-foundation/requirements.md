# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing Next.js e-commerce application into a comprehensive real-time chat platform foundation. The system will support WebSocket-based real-time messaging, user authentication integration, and a flexible architecture that can later accommodate advanced features like voice/video calls, channels, servers, file sharing, and dual workspace modes (professional vs social). This initial implementation focuses on establishing the core chat infrastructure and basic messaging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and access the chat platform using my existing account, so that I can seamlessly transition from the current system to the new chat functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through NextAuth THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve their chat profile
2. WHEN a user accesses the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display their authenticated status and profile information
3. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL disconnect their WebSocket connection and clear their session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send and receive messages in real-time, so that I can have instant conversations with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types and sends a message THEN the system SHALL immediately broadcast it to all connected users via WebSocket
2. WHEN a message is received THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat interface without page refresh
3. WHEN a user connects to the chat THEN the system SHALL load the most recent 50 messages
4. WHEN a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL show an error indicator and allow retry
5. WHEN a user is typing THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators to other users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see who is currently online, so that I know who is available for conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the chat THEN the system SHALL add them to the online users list
2. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove them from the online users list within 30 seconds
3. WHEN the online users list changes THEN the system SHALL update all connected clients in real-time
4. WHEN a user views the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display the current count of online users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages to be persistently stored, so that I can view conversation history when I return to the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with timestamp, sender, and content
2. WHEN a user joins the chat THEN the system SHALL load and display historical messages in chronological order
3. WHEN a user scrolls up in the chat THEN the system SHALL load older messages in batches of 50
4. WHEN message history is loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll position and user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be responsive and intuitive, so that I can easily communicate across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the chat on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface
2. WHEN a user accesses the chat on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured desktop interface
3. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL clear the input field and focus for the next message
4. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL auto-scroll to the bottom unless the user is viewing history
5. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL focus the message input field

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want WebSocket connections to be stable and handle errors gracefully, so that users have a reliable chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. WHEN reconnection succeeds THEN the system SHALL sync any missed messages and update the user interface
3. WHEN connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL display connection status to the user
4. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL handle graceful disconnection and reconnection of all clients
5. WHEN WebSocket errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat system to integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js and Prisma architecture, so that it maintains consistency with the current codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the chat system THEN the system SHALL use the existing Prisma database and authentication setup
2. WHEN adding new database models THEN the system SHALL follow the existing schema patterns and naming conventions
3. WHEN creating API routes THEN the system SHALL use Next.js API routes and maintain existing middleware patterns
4. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use the existing UI component library (DaisyUI) and styling approach
5. WHEN adding WebSocket functionality THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing server architecture
